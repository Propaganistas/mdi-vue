# Material Design Icons - Tree-shakeable Vue3 components

This repository exports all icons of [@mdi/js](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-JS) as self-contained, **tree-shakeable** Vue components. 
A nightly GitHub workflow has been set up to automatically publish new releases when available to stay on par with `@mdi/js`.

## Usage

Please refer to the [package's README](https://github.com/Propaganistas/mdi-vue3/blob/master/dist).

## Manual icon build
```
npm install
npm run build
```
